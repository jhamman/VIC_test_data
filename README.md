VIC Test Data
=======

This repository includes the test datasets required for running the [VIC test suite](http://vic.readthedocs.org/en/develop/Development/Testing).

1.  **examples**: a set of examples that users may download and run. This repository points to https://github.com/jhamman/VIC_sample_data.
1.  **science**: tests that aim to assess the model's scientific skill. Many of these tests are compared to observations of some kind. This repository includes a link to be used to download the datasets for running the science tests.
1.  **release**: longer, full domain simulations performed prior to release demonstrating model output for a final release. This repository includes a link to be used to download the datasets for running the release tests.
